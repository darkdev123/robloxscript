As you may know, this project is open source (not the script only other things)
this is because I want the Synapse X mode to be unreadable and possibly bypassed so it always returns true.
Sorry for the inconvenience that may have been caused due to this i'm really sorry for it but i will release the
version where its unobfuscated and without the part of the script where it enables / disables Synapse X mode.
For those who are wondering: yes the EXE launcher uses WeAreDevs API
